The 5day Forecast

## Introduction

Welcome to challenge 6 "utilizing the weather API". This project truly tested everything that I knew and pushed me to my limit regarding how much I could learn without assistance. During this project, I had to be extremely resourceful and motivated. This was truly a trial and error project if I have never done one myself

## Who is this for?

This is for my personal use and a study guide for anyone who wants to use it to learn about API applications.

## why did I make this?

I made this application to add to my portfolio as it is simple yet complex. While basic it allows for growth, in which I will be adding more to it at some point.
